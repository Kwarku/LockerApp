Hello User

You can change every single button image and background image.
If You want do this just:
1. Open "src" folder
2. Open "image" folder
3. Take any ".png" file and give it to him the same name like now it's
    -background.png         -> it's background image
    -Button(Number).png     -> it's background of every single button
    -ButtonClear.png        -> it's cleaning button
    -ButtonEnter.png        -> it's enter button
4. This is end. Now you have you own application look :)

Off course you can change sounds:
1. Open "sounds" folder
2. Take any sounds effects in ".wav" format
3. Give it name like original files. ("click.wav" "error.wav" "lose.wav" "win.wav")

Now take a look about movie. The movie shows when user guess your code.
If you want movie:
1. Take movie file in format ".mp4"
2. Give it name " WinMovie.mp4 "
3. Put your movie on your own locale disk C:
    -don't use any folder
    -don't change file name
4. It's works (i hope :D )


Now take a look about more important things.
